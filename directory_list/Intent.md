<h1>Intercepting Implicit Intent to Load Arbitrary URL</h1>
These are the part of IPC (Inter app communication).
Intents are the objects that contain the message information. 
it is used to perform any operations.

Types 1. Implicit 2. explicit
Explicit Intents: Explicit Intents specify the target component by its class name. They are used to start a specific component within the same application.

Implicit is used to perform operations which is defined.

<h3>Risks of Implicit Intents: Interception and Data Leakage </h3>
One of the major risks is the interception of implicit intents by malicious apps installed on the same device. Since implicit intents do not specify a 
specific component, any app with a matching intent filter can intercept and handle the intent, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or execution 
of malicious code. 

<h3>Best Practices for Securing Implicit Intents</h3>

To protect your Android app from interception and malicious attacks, it is essential to follow best practices for handling implicit intents. By implementing the following security measures, you can ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your app’s sensitive data. 

1) Validate and Sanitize Input Data 
When handling implicit intents, it is crucial to validate and sanitize any input data before using it in your app. Ensure that the data received from
implicit intents is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any security vulnerabilities such as code injection or data leakage. 

3) Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in Implicit Intents 
Avoid passing sensitive data through implicit intents whenever possible. If your app requires the transmission of sensitive information,
consider using explicit intents or other secure communication channels, such as encrypted APIs or secure sockets layer (SSL) connections. 

4) Implement Intent Filtering Carefully 
When defining intent filters in your app’s manifest file, be cautious about the actions, data types, and categories you declare.
Avoid exposing sensitive functionality or data through intent filters and ensure that only necessary components are registered to handle specific actions. 

6) Limit App Permissions 
Carefully review and restrict the permissions requested by your app. Only request the minimum set of permissions necessary for your app’s functionality.
This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive user data and reduces the attack surface for potential security vulnerabilities.
